# Indaprojekt - Bomberman 

This project is about creating a Bomberman-like game. Here, two players will play against eachother and try to kill eachother. Player one moves around with the arrow keys and places a bomb with the dot-key, while player two moves around with the WASD-keys and places a bomb with the T-key. The bomb will cause an explosion which travels in four directions. There will be a startmenu to view instructions and press play. There will be a border around the map wich will prevent movement outside of the map, and have square "walls" which will be unbreakable and prevent player movement. "Crates" will be placed to prevent player movement but will break if one of the bombexplosions hits it. 

The game will use JavaFX for graphics interaction.

## How to install

1. Download and install JavaFX.
2. Download and install an IDE that works with JavaFX and use it as an SDK.
3. Clone the repo and open it from Intellij.
