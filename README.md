# Indaprojekt - Bomberman 

This project is about creating a Bomberman-like game. Here, the player will be able to control a bomberman with the arrow-keys and will try to kill 3 other AI-bombermen with a bomb that drops with spacebar. The bomb will cause an explosion which travels in four directions. There will be a startmenu to view instructions and press play. There will be a border around the map wich will prevent movement outside of the map, and have square "walls" which will be unbreakable and prevent player movement. "Wooden boxes" will be placed to prevent player movement but will break if one of the bombexplosions hits it. 

The game will use JavaFX for graphics interaction.

The only way right now to download and play the game is to clone the repo and run the main class.
